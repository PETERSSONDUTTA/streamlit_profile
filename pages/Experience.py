                - Led a data science team in leveraging equipment signals (e.g., pressure, voltage, process time) to train machine learning models for predicting critical wafer output metrics such as deposition thickness and etching depth.
                - **Objective:** Achieved 100% product quality coverage without additional CAPEX for metrology tools while reducing cycle time.
                - **Achievements:** Demonstrated models with RMSE (root mean squared error) <10% of process standard deviation, validated by production data. Integrated Virtual Metrology into the SPC system for enhanced statistical process control and quality assurance.
                - **Business Impact:** Supported the ramp-up of specialized AI memory chip production, outpacing competitors to secure several hundred million dollars in revenue by 2024 and maintaining a full order book through 2025.
