                  - **Objective:** Developed a binary classification model using an open Kaggle dataset to predict whether a bank customer would subscribe to a term deposit during a marketing campaign.
                  - **Challenge:** Addressed data imbalance with only 11% successful subscriptions by choosing balanced accuracy as the performance metric.
                  - **Achievement:** Achieved a balanced accuracy of 83% with a recall of 70%. Identified the most critical factor influencing the outcome: the duration since the last marketing campaign with the customer.

                  - **Objective:** Built a regression model using an open Kaggle dataset to predict house prices in the US. RMSE is chosen as the model performance metric to prioritize in reducing prediction error.
                  - **Challenge:** Set RMSE target to be less than 30% of the standard deviation (\$23,833) based on the mean sale price (\$180,921) and standard deviation (\$79,442).
                  - **Achievement:** Initial Gradient Boosting model achieved an RMSE of \$25,367 (31.9% of standard deviation). Enhanced the model to a Time-Based Split XGBoost Regression, achieving an RMSE of \$22,619, meeting the target criteria.

                  - **Objective:** Demonstrate the use case of Generative AI by creating a personal Digital Twin Job Interviewee Agent to interact with recruiters and hiring managers. Utilizing prompt engineering, the Agent will retrieve my personal knowledge data (e.g., my resume, sample interview answers) through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and use the relevant information to respond effectively.
                  - **Challenge:** While prompt engineering is valuable for shaping LLM responses, the format and quality of the RAG documents are equally crucial. To ensure high-quality conversational responses, I have learnt that transforming my RAG documents from bullet-point lists into a more conversational format is the most effective approach. Another challenge I encountered is the issue of chat memory. The Agent sometimes struggles to respond effectively to previous conversations. This could potentially be resolved by using a long-context Language Model (LLM) that can maintain a better memory of past interactions.
