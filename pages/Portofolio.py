                  - **Objective:** Developed a binary classification model using an open Kaggle dataset to predict whether a bank customer would subscribe to a term deposit during a marketing campaign.
                  - **Challenge:** Addressed data imbalance with only 11% successful subscriptions by choosing balanced accuracy as the performance metric.
                  - **Achievement:** Achieved a balanced accuracy of 83% with a recall of 70%. Identified the most critical factor influencing the outcome: the duration since the last marketing campaign with the customer.
